Several Python scripts were used for various functions:

lda folder: Contains LDA code. Pass it the reviews.txt file to run LDA on it. Refer Readme for LDA folder.


gensim_lda.py - Used to Run LDA on sample text file   
parse.py - used to parse the data into review text that can be given as input to preprocess.py
topuser_details.txt - Input file to converIDstoNumbers.py
convertIDstoNumbers.py - Used to get the data into correct format for running matrix factorization. Also used to split the dataset into training and testing sets. It splits the data into 80%-20%.
lda_output.txt - The output obtained after running LDA on the review text.
preprocessText.py - Used to preprocessed the parse text to get rit of stopwords, grammer and doing POS tagging.
topredict.py - Takes the output files from graphlab and brings it back into format that can be used by the online vizualiation tool to show it on google maps.



1. Run parse.py as follows:
python parse.py

It will take the reviews_clsutered.txt file as input and generate reviews.txt file. This file is already in the LDA folder. Head over to the LDA folder and run lda using the command given in the README.
